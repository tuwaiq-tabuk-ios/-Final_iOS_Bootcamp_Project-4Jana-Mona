An application inspired by the PICS system, where this system was developed by Dr.Andrew Bundy and speech-language pathologist Lori Frost to help autistic children and people with developmental disabilities communicate with others, a system that does not eliminate verbal communication, but the fact that most autistic children find it difficult to communicate and 50  % of them are non-verbal. Non-verbal communication is considered a means of communication and enhancement of social interaction, the development of speech and increasing the chances of its production. 


Non-verbal communication is one of the treatment methods for children who suffer from communication problems. It is a system that depends on the exchange of communication through images;  Because autistic children learn to exchange contact through sight, mainly with the use of physical and social reinforcement.  

The suffering that a child with autism suffers from in the process of verbal and motor imitation, in addition to his lack of initiative, is what prompted specialists to use the image system that motivates individuals to communicate with others, the child chooses what he wants from the images and the parents or the teacher achieves his choice.


## Project description
The application is divided into two categories: Inside the house and outside the house.

Each category has several sections 
     - Inside the house: bathrooms , bedrooms , Kitchen...
     - outside the house: hospital , restaurant, garden , school...
  
Each section contains its own pictures can take it from camera or upload it from library.

For instance, in the ""child want spoon"" scenario, he/she chooses ""Inside the house"" category, then ""kitchen"" section, and within that section he/she presses the ""spoon"" image. Then his/her assistant can understand that he/she needs a spoon.

The app has a chat for all users to exchange information, exercises or questions about their children's behavior.
